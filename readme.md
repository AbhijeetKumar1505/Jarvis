### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
   cd jarvis-ai-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create `config.toml` file:
   ```toml
   [openai]
   api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
   model = "gpt-4"
   max_tokens = 150
   temperature = 0.7

   [elevenlabs]
   api_key = "your_elevenlabs_api_key"
   voice_id = "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"  # Indian accent

   [wolframalpha]
   app_id = "your_wolfram_app_id"

   [settings]
   max_history = 10
   ```

## Usage üé§

1. Start Jarvis:
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```

2. Wake Jarvis by saying "Jarvis" or give direct commands

3. Try these commands:
   - "Jarvis, open YouTube"
   - "Jarvis, set a reminder for 5 minutes to check the oven"
   - "Jarvis, tell me a joke"
   - "Jarvis, what's the capital of France?"
   - "Jarvis, increase brightness by 20%"

## Voice Configuration üéôÔ∏è

The assistant supports multiple voice options:

1. **ElevenLabs** (Premium, recommended):
   - Indian accent included by default
   - Change `voice_id` in config for different voices

2. **gTTS** (Free Google Text-to-Speech):
   - Automatic fallback if ElevenLabs fails

3. **pyttsx3** (Local):
   - Ultimate fallback option

## Troubleshooting ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Common Issues:**

1. **Microphone not working**:
   - Check your system audio settings
   - Ensure `pyaudio` is properly installed

2. **API errors**:
   - Verify your API keys in `config.toml`
   - Check your OpenAI account for GPT-4 access

3. **Command not recognized**:
   - Speak clearly and naturally
   - Check the available commands list
